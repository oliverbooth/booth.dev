    Thanks for getting in touch! While I do my best to read to all inquiries, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to
    respond to your message. Nevertheless, I appreciate you taking the time to reach out to me and I will respond if I
    can.

    <p>
        I am politely asking that you respect my inbox and keep your unsolicited advertising away. This is a simple
        request. If you send me any kind of spam after this, you have demonstrated that you do not have the basic human
        decency to respect my wishes or my privacy, and you have lost the privilege for me to respect yours. I
        <strong>will</strong> block your email address, and I will add your name to my public blacklist of spammers,
        which you can find <a asp-page="/Contact/Blacklist">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        While I don't necessarily consider receiving legitimate offers for SEO services to be spam, I am not interested
        in your services at this time. I understand that you are just doing your job, but hopefully you can do it more
        efficiently by going to others who are more receptive to your services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not contact me about SEO services. If you do, while I will not publicly blacklist your address, you will -
        however - be blocked.
    </p>
