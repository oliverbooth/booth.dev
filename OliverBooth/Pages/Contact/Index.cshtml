<p>
    Thanks for getting in touch! While I do my best to read to all inquiries, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to
    respond to your message. Nevertheless, I appreciate you taking the time to reach out to me and I will respond if I
    can.

    <p>
        In the short time that this site has been live, I have received a considerable amount of spam that I suspect is
        automated. As such, I added background reCaptcha validation to this form to minimise the amount of
        bot-written junk I receive. However, some spam still gets through - that means there are humans reading this.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am politely asking that you respect my inbox and keep your unsolicited advertising away. This is a simple
        request.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you send me any kind of spam after this, you have demonstrated that you do not have the basic human decency
        to respect my wishes or my privacy, and you have lost the privilege for me to respect yours. I
        <strong>will</strong> block your email address and report you to your email provider. I will also begin to
        maintain a public blacklist of spammers, so that others may do the same. You will lose all credibility, and you
        <strong>will</strong> be publicly shamed for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This <strong>does not apply</strong> to legitimate businesses who are offering something genuine
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to me specifically</span>, nor to individuals who are interested in my
        services.
