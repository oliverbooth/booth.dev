<p>
    Thank you for taking the time to consider contributing to one of my open source projects! I am always looking for
    ways to improve my code, and I appreciate any and all contributions that I receive. You do not need to contact
    me to do so, just submit a pull request on GitHub and I will review it as soon as I can.

    Below are links to the repositories for each of my active projects. This list is subject to change at any time. If
    you'd like to contribute to a project that is not listed below, it is likely that I am not currently actively
    maintaining it, I would recommend that you fork the repository and continue development on your own as unfortunately
    I have no timeline as to when I will start such projects back up again.
