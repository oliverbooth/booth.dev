    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I am committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any information you provide to me when
        using my website. This Privacy Policy outlines my practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
        information I may gather from users of my website.
    </p>

    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>
        When you choose to contact me via the contact form on my website, I collect your name and email address. This
        information is provided voluntarily by you and is necessary for me to respond to your inquiries and engage in a
        conversation. I do not collect any additional personally identifiable information about you through the contact
        form.
    </p>
    <p>I do not use any cookies or similar tracking technologies that can identify individual users.</p>
    <p>
        Please note that my website includes a Disqus integration for commenting on blog posts. Disqus is a third-party
        service, and their use of cookies and collection of personal information are governed by their own privacy
        policies. I have no control over the information collected by Disqus, and I encourage you to review their
        privacy policy to understand how your information may be used by them.

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
        The name and email address you provide through the contact form are used solely for the purpose of responding to
        your inquiries and engaging in relevant conversation. I keep this information confidential and do not disclose,
        sell, or share it with any third parties unless required by law or with your explicit consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do not use your personal information for marketing purposes or send you any unsolicited communications. Once
        our conversation is complete and no longer necessary, I will securely delete your personal information unless
        otherwise required to retain it by applicable laws or regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
        I do not disclose your personal information to any third parties unless required by law or with your explicit
        consent. I maintain strict confidentiality and take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information
        from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, please be aware that my website contains links to third-party websites and services. I am not
        responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. I encourage you to review the
        privacy policies of those third-party sites before providing any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        I prioritize the security of your personal information and take reasonable precautions to protect it. However,
        please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and I
        cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other operational,
        legal, or regulatory reasons. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. The
        revised policy will be effective immediately upon posting.
