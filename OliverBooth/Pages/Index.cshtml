<h1 class="display-4">Hi, I'm Oliver.</h1>
<p class="lead">I'm a tech enthusiast, coffee drinker, and software developer.</p>

<p>
    My primary focus is C#, though I have dabbled in several other languages such as Java, Kotlin, VB, C/C++, Python,
    and others. Over the years I've built up a collection of projects. Some of which I'm extremely proud of, and others
    I've quietly abandoned and buried. I'm currently working on a few projects that I hope to release in the near
    future, but in the meantime, feel free to check out some of my <a asp-page="/Projects/Index">previous work.</a>
</p>

<p>
    I've also written a few <a asp-page="/tutorials/index">tutorials</a> on various topics, usually involving
    information not readily available elsewhere. I hope you find them useful.
</p>
