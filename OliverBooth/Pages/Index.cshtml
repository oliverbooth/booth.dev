        My primary focus is C#, though I have dabbled in several other languages such as Java, Kotlin, VB, C/C++,
        Python, and others. Over the years I've built up a collection of projects. Some of which I'm extremely proud of,
        and others I've quietly abandoned and buried. I'm currently working on a few projects that I hope to release in
        the near future, but in the meantime, feel free to check out some of my
        <a asp-page="/Projects/Index">previous work</a>.

        I've also written a few <a asp-page="/Tutorials/Index">tutorials</a> on various topics, usually involving
        information not readily available elsewhere. I hope you find them useful. On occasion, I also write about other
        topics that I find interesting, such as
        <a asp-page="/Blog/Index">my thoughts on the state of the world or the tech industry</a>.
