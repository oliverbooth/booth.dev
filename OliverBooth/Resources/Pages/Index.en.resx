        <value>My primary focus is C#, though I have dabbled in several other languages such as Java, Kotlin, VB, C/C++, Python, and others. Over the years I've built up a collection of projects. Some of which I'm extremely proud of, and others I've quietly abandoned and buried. I'm currently working on a few projects that I hope to release in the near future, but in the meantime, feel free to check out some of my &lt;a asp-page="/Projects/Index"&gt;previous work.&lt;/a&gt;</value>
