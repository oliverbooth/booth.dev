            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any information you provide to me
            when using my website. This Privacy Policy outlines my practices regarding the collection, use, and
            disclosure of information I may gather from users of my website.
        </p>

        <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>
            I do not collect personal information from you on this website. I do not use any cookies or similar tracking
            technologies that can identify individual users.
        </p>
        <p>Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Server access logs automatically record information such as your IP address, browser type, and request
                timestamps. These logs are used for security and operational purposes only and are only reviewed in the
                event of a security incident or troubleshooting need.
            </li>
            <li>
                My website includes GitHub integration for comments on blog posts and tutorials. GitHub may collect
                information according to its own <a href="@githubPrivacyUrl">privacy policy</a>. I have no control over
                GitHub's data collection.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
            I do not use any personal information for marketing purposes or share it with third parties. Logged data is
            only used for server operation and security.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>
            I do not disclose your personal information to any third parties, as I do not collect any.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, please be aware that my website contains links to third-party websites and services. I am not
            responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. I encourage you to review the
            privacy policies of those third-party sites before providing any personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            I prioritize the security of your personal information and take reasonable precautions to protect it.
            However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100%
            secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for
            any updates. The revised policy will be effective immediately upon posting.
        </p>
