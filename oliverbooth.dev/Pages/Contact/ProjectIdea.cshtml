<p class="lead">Project Idea</p>
<p>
    I'm always looking for new projects to work on, and I'm open to suggestions. If you have an idea for a project that
    you'd like to see me work on, please feel free to get in touch. If you'd like to collaborate, please
    <strong>do not</strong> use this form, instead, please use <a asp-page="/contact/jobopportunity">this one</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that by submitting an idea through the form on this page, you acknowledge and agree that any
    intellectual property rights associated with the idea, including but not limited to copyright, patent, or any other
    proprietary rights, shall be immediately and irrevocably transferred to me. You understand that this transfer of
    intellectual property rights grants me the unrestricted and exclusive right to use, modify, reproduce, distribute,
    disclose, or otherwise exploit the idea for any purpose, without the obligation to provide credit or compensation to
